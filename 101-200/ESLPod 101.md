>Let's get started!
>
>I bought a new DVD player last weekend.
>
>When I got home and hooked it up, I realized that it was defective.
>
>I trudged back to the store to return it.
>
>Clerk: Next, please.
>
>Jeff: Hi, I bought this DVD player last Saturday and I'd like to return it.
>
>Clerk: What's the reason for the return?
>
>Jeff: It's not working properly.
>
>Clerk: What's the matter with it?
>
>Jeff: Well, several things. First of all, the remote doesn't work.
>
>Clerk: Did you put batteries in it?
>
>Jeff: Yes, of course, but it still didn't work. I couldn't change any of the functions on the display. It also doesn't fast forward when I'm playing a DVD. It rewinds but it won't fast forward while the picture is playing. On top of that, I couldn't get the closed caption feature to work.
>
>Clerk: Okay, I see. Anything else?
>
>Jeff: Yes, as you can see, the casing scratches very easily. I just took it out of the box and put it on my entertainment unit and I got all of these scratches.
>
>Clerk: Oh, are you sure you didn't scratch it with your keys or set some things on top of it?
>
>Jeff: No, I'm sure.
>
>Clerk: Well, I'm sure that it's just a problem with this one player. I've never seen this with any of the models made by this brand. Do you have the receipt?
>
>Jeff: Yes, here it is.
>
>Clerk: Do you want to exchange it or return it?
>
>Jeff: I'd like to return it.
>
>Clerk: Okay, how did you pay for it?
>
>Jeff: With a credit card.
>
>Clerk: Can I see your card? Okay, I'll credit it back to your credit card. Can you fill out this form with your name and phone number, and sign at the bottom?
>
>Jeff: Sure.
>
>Clerk: Great. Here's your credit card back and $95 has been credited to your credit card. Anything else I can help you with?
>
>Jeff: Oh, there is one more thing. Can you tell me if you carry iPod Nanos?
