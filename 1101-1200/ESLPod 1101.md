>Let's get started.
>
>Oscar: So you're back from your mother's birthday dinner. How was it?
>
>Priscilla: Same old, same old. It isn't a family gathering without a major meltdown or blowup.
>
>Oscar: Yikes, what happened?
>
>Priscilla: You know how it is. It starts out with bickering and somebody taking offense at some slight or dig, or bringing up some old grievance.
>
>Oscar: Well, that happens in most families.
>
>Priscilla: Yeah, but in mine, they often turn into screaming matches. We all raise our voices and somebody always storms out.
>
>Oscar: Even at your mother's birthday dinner?
>
>Priscilla: The occasion doesn't matter. My mother tries to be the peacemaker, but it doesn't take much for tempers to flare.
>
>Oscar: That never happens in my family.
>
>Priscilla: What?! Your family doesn't fight when it gets together?
>
>Oscar: No, we try to sweep things under the rug and put on a brave face.
>
>Priscilla: What happens when you get mad at each other?
>
>Oscar: Nothing.
>
>Priscilla: What do you mean nothing?
>
>Oscar: A lot of our family meals are eaten in stony silence.
>
>Priscilla: Wow, I think I prefer our knock-down, drag-out fights!
