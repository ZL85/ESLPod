> Let's get started.
>
> Sales clerk: Good afternoon. What can I help you find?
>
> Bo: I'm looking for a suit for work.
>
> Sales clerk: I'm sure we have something for you. Are you looking for a traditional or contemporary suit?
>
> Bo: I'm not sure. I'd like to try on some different ones.
>
> Sales clerk: That's no problem. Let me show you a few over here. This is a two-button pinstripe suit that's made of 100% wool and has a flat front. What do you think?
>
> Bo: It looks nice. How about this one?
>
> Sales clerk: Oh, this is a very fine suit. As you can see, it's double-breasted and is fully lined. The pants are pleated. Would you like to try it on?
>
> Bo: Sure.
>
> Sales clerk: Just follow me to the dressing rooms in the back. Here you are. My name is Caroline. Just let me know if you need anything.
>
> Bo [comes out of the dressing room wearing one of the suits]: I like this single-breasted one. I like the side vents. All of these suits need to be dry cleaned, is that right? I travel a lot in my job and I worry about my suits getting dirty on the road.
>
> Sales clerk: Yes, they all need to be dry cleaned, but since both of these suits are a dark color, that shouldn't be too big of a problem. How does that feel?
>
> Bo: It's a good fit and it's very comfortable. Okay. I'll take this one.
>
> Sales clerk: Certainly. I'll ring you up. Do you need anything else? A vest, suspenders, or a garment bag to store the suit?
>
> Bo: No, thanks. I'll just take the suit.
>
> Sales clerk: No problem. Just follow me.
