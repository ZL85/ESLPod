>Let's get started.
>
>Victor: Humph!
>
>Rosaria: What's the matter?
>
>Victor: I just got back from my first yoga class and I was sorely disappointed.
>
>Rosaria: I've heard that yoga is very good low-impact exercise and helps with stress relief. It's supposed to calm the mind and strengthen the body.
>
>Victor: Yeah, right.
>
>Rosaria: It sounds like you had a bad experience. Did you have a bad teacher?
>
>Victor: The teacher was fine. I learned about mantras and chakras, I learned breathing techniques, and I tried a few basic poses.
>
>Rosaria: That all sounds right from my own experience, such as it is. But, there are a lot of different types of yoga. Maybe you need to try a different kind.
>
>Victor: The problem wasn't the kind of yoga being practiced. It was the class.
>
>Rosaria: Were the mats uncomfortable?
>
>Victor: No.
>
>Rosaria: Was it too cramped?
>
>Victor: No.
>
>Rosaria: Then what was the problem?
>
>Victor: There was too much testosterone in the room.
>
>Rosaria: You mean you were in a class with just men?
>
>Victor: Yeah.
>
>Rosaria: And that was a problem?
>
>Victor: Do you think I would be taking a yoga class if I weren't trying to meet women?!
