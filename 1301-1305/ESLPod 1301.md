>Let's get started.
>
>Ian: Oh, look at your team. How cute! You've recruited the puniest players you could find.
>
>Shannon: Are those your players? They're humungous!
>
>Ian: My players are the best around. They're massive in size and massive in talent. They'll crush your teeny-tiny team without breaking a sweat.
>
>Shannon: Our teams are supposed to have players from the same age group, so why is it that I have normal-size players and yours are gigantic? Something doesn't smell right.
>
>Ian: It all comes down to recruitment. I recruited the best players.
>
>Shannon: Are you sure you don't have a few ringers on your team, some who are a few years older than they're supposed to be?
>
>Ian: Of course I don't. I can't help it if the best players gravitated toward my team and to my better coaching. Ready to be schooled?
>
>Shannon: I think I'd better give my team a pep talk first.
>
>A few of them look like they're ready to bolt â€“ or throw up!
