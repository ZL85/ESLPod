>Let's get started.
>
>Lorraine: Hi, this is a surprise. To what do I owe this pleasure?
>
>Terrance: Can't I just drop in on my little sister unannounced to see how she is? I was just in this neck of the woods and thought I would pay you a visit.
>
>Lorraine: Sure you were. Of course, I'm glad to see you, but this is just a little out of the blue.
>
>Terrance: What do you mean?
>
>Lorraine: I haven't seen you in over five months, and you just happened to be in the neighborhood?
>
>Terrance: Well, I wasn't exactly in the neighborhood, but I wanted to see my favorite sister.
>
>Lorraine: Your only sister. Okay, out with it. What are you doing here?
>
>Terrance: Uh, well, I was thinking of taking a year off from school to pursue my art. I really feel I need to devote some time to my painting to see if I can make it as an artist.
>
>Lorraine: Mom and Dad are not going to like that.
>
>Terrance: I know and that's where you come in.
>
>Lorraine: You want me to run interference for you with Mom and Dad.
>
>Terrance: Yeah, they would take it a lot better coming from you, don't you think?
>
>Lorraine: No, I don't.
>
>Terrance: You've always been the responsible one…I'm just saying…
>
>Lorraine: And I'm just saying that I'm not going to do your dirty work for you!
