>Let's get started.
>
>Marisa: When we go to our favorite vacation spot in two months, let's stay at a different hotel.
>
>Oscar: I like the hotel we always stay at. It's in a convenient location and we're already familiar with it.
>
>Marisa: That's just it. It's tried and true, but there's no novelty and excitement in staying in the same place year after year.
>
>Oscar: I don't need novelty.
>
>Marisa: Let's just consider some of these other hotels I've been reading about. They are very highly ranked and their ratings are very good.
>
>Oscar: You're putting strangers' reviews above our own experience?
>
>Marisa: Of course not,but just look at this hotel. It received three stars out of four, and it has a lot of pros.
>
>Oscar: Let me see that. It also has some cons, such as being noisy and pricy.
>
>Marisa: Okay, maybe that isn't the best example. I didn't notice that they got dinged on those things, but let's look at a few others.
>
>Oscar: I'll keep an open mind, but I'm dubious about online reviews. I take everything I read with a grain of salt. The only people who post reviews are those who love it or hate it.
>
>Marisa: I'll just find a hotel that everyone loves.
>
>Oscar: And that doesn't break the bank?
>
>Marisa: Right.
