>Let's get started.
>
>Alice: Ooh, look at these! Don't I look great? I've always wanted sunglasses like these.
>
>Pierre: You're supposed to be here helping me pick out frames for my new bifocals.
>
>Alice: I don't know why you won't get progressives. That's what everybody is getting these days.
>
>Pierre: I've always had bifocals and that's what I'm going to get.
>
>Alice: Are you going to get metal, plastic, or rimless frames?
>
>Pierre: I'm not sure. The optician said that with my prescription, I could get any kind.
>
>Alice: Okay, try these. How do they feel?
>
>Pierre: I like the way the hinges move, but they're too small for my head. Hey, these are nice. I think I'll go with these.
>
>Alice: There's no accounting for taste! Okay, but what about the lenses? There are so many options. You can get ones that reduce glare, ones that darken automatically, ones with anti-scratch coating
>
>Pierre: I want to keep it nice and simple. I don't want any of those options.
>
>Alice: How about these for a backup pair? They're designer frames.
>
>Pierre: Give me those. I should have known better than to let you tag along. What was I thinking?
