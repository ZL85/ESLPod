>Let's get started.
>
>Leo: Where have you been?
>
>Mai: I've been meeting with an agent. You know I've wanted to pursue a career in acting for a long time, but today I actually met with a real agent. She thinks I have potential.
>
>Leo: Is she going to sign you?
>
>Mai: She might. She suggested a few improvements that are going to make me more salable as an actress.
>
>Leo: What did she suggest?
>
>Mai: Well, she thought I should get some hair extensions to make my hair look longer and fuller.
>
>Leo: There's nothing wrong with your hair.
>
>Mai: Well, she thought it could use some sprucing up. She also recommended getting my teeth capped. At the very least, she said I should have teeth whitening done.
>
>Leo: Your teeth look nice and natural. There's nothing wrong with them.
>
>Mai: She also suggested getting a spray tan, so I'd look healthier.
>
>Leo: You already look healthy. Is she crazy?
>
>Mai: No, I think she's giving me good constructive criticism. I want to make myself as salable as possible.
>
>Leo: It sounds like she wants to stamp out all of your individuality and turn you into a clone of every other actress out there.
>
>Mai: I was thinking of taking her advice. I want to be salable.
>
>Leo: You're a person, not a piece of meat. Salable, schmalable! Don't you even think about it!
