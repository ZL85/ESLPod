# ESLPod 901

>Let's get started.
>
>Lucinda: You look tired. Are you all right?
>
>Elan: I'm fine. It's this clinical trial I'm enrolled in. I'm suffering from some side effects.
>
>Lucinda: Are they serious?
>
>Elan: No, they're not too bad. I was told to expect some adverse reactions in the first weeks of the pilot study. I guess that's why only a small group of volunteers is taking part right now. It's so they can judge the drug's effectiveness before the pharmaceutical company does a large-scale trial.
>
>Lucinda: At least you know you're not in the group getting a placebo.
>
>Elan: Who knows? I hope not. If I successfully get through this first phase, I'll get a full dose of the drug in phase two.
>
>Lucinda: Then you may once and for all be rid of Podcaster's Disease.
>
>Elan: I really hope so. No one should go through life sounding like a podcaster.
