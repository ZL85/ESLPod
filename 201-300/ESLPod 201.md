>Let's get started.
>
>Suzanna: Hey, the back of the line is over there.
>
>Ivan: I was here. I just stepped out of line for a minute to get some cash.
>
>Suzanna: Yeah, right. I don't remember you being in line ahead of me.
>
>Ivan: Come on. Let's do this. We'll flip for it. If it's heads,I win and I get to get back into line. If it's tails, you win and I'll go to the back of the line.
>
>Suzanna: All right. I'll take those odds. You're on.
>
>Ivan: Here goesâ€¦Oh, it's heads! I win.
>
>Suzanna: I guess it's your lucky day.
>
>Ivan: I guess so. How about going double or nothing?
>
>Suzanna: What are the stakes?
>
>Ivan: If it's tails and you win, I go to the back of the line and I have to buy you a drink when we get inside. If it's heads and I win, I get back in line in front of you and you buy me a drink.
>
>Suzanna: So, no matter what happens I have to have a drink with you?
>
>Ivan: That's the idea. What do you say?
>
>Suzanna: Okay, you talked me into it. Let's see if your luck will hold up.
>
>Ivan: I've got a good feeling it will.
